## What is Nyx?

Nyx is a modular OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and reconnaissance tool for cybersecurity professionals, bug bounty hunters, and authorized penetration testers.

It automates the first phase of security testing: **passive reconnaissance** — gathering information about a target without directly attacking it.

---

## Features

### 11 Modules

| Module | What It Does | Type |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **DNS Enumeration** | DNS records, zone transfers, subdomain brute-force | Passive |
| **WHOIS Intel** | Domain ownership, ASN, geolocation, CDN detection | Passive |
| **Port Scanner** | TCP port scanning, banner grabbing (top 100 ports) | Active |
| **Web Fingerprinting** | CMS detection, tech stack, security headers | Active |
| **Cert Transparency** | Find subdomains from SSL certificate logs | Passive |
| **Username Search** | Search 21 platforms for a username | Passive |
| **WAF Detection** | Detect Web Application Firewalls | Active |
| **Email Security** | SPF/DMARC/DKIM audit, spoofing risk | Passive |
| **Google Dorks** | Generate reconnaissance Google search queries | Passive |
| **Shodan Lookup** | Query Shodan for known vulnerabilities | Passive |
| **Email Harvester** | Find emails associated with a domain | Passive |

### Key Strengths

## Module Details

### 1. DNS Enumeration
Queries all major DNS record types, attempts zone transfers, and brute-forces subdomains.

**Best for:** Finding all subdomains of a domain  
**Output:** A, AAAA, MX, TXT, NS records + found subdomains  
**Legal:** ✅ Completely passive, public DNS queries

### 2. WHOIS Intelligence
Retrieves domain registration, ASN, ISP, geolocation, and detects CDNs.

**Best for:** Understanding domain ownership and infrastructure  
**Output:** Registrar, ASN, geolocation, CDN status  
**Legal:** ✅ Public WHOIS records

### 3. Port Scanner
Scans top 100 TCP ports and attempts banner grabbing.

**Best for:** Finding open services  
**Output:** Open ports, service banners, versions  
**Legal:** ⚠️ **Active scanning** — ensure you have permission

### 4. Web Fingerprinting
Analyzes HTTP headers, CMS signatures, security configuration, SSL certificates.

**Best for:** Understanding what's running on a web server  
**Output:** CMS type, tech stack, SSL info, security headers  
**Legal:** ⚠️ **Makes HTTP requests** — confirm authorization

### 5. Certificate Transparency
Searches SSL certificate logs for subdomains (crt.sh).

**Best for:** Finding subdomains never found by DNS brute-force  
**Output:** Subdomains from SSL certs, DNS resolution status  
**Legal:** ✅ Querying public certificate database

### 6. Username Search
Searches 21 platforms (GitHub, Twitter, Reddit, etc.) for a username.

**Best for:** OSINT on individuals  
**Output:** Accounts found, profile URLs, high-value profiles flagged  
**Legal:** ✅ Public profile searches

### 7. WAF Detection
Detects Web Application Firewalls using passive signatures and active payload probing.

**Best for:** Understanding what protection is in place  
**Output:** WAF brand, confidence level, bypass hints  
**Legal:** ⚠️ **Active probing** — may trigger alerts, authorized testing only

### 8. Email Security Audit
Checks SPF, DMARC, DKIM configuration and calculates security score.

**Best for:** Finding email spoofing vulnerabilities  
**Output:** Email security score, SPF policy, DMARC enforcement  
**Legal:** ✅ Public DNS TXT records

### 9. Google Dorks
Generates targeted Google search queries to find exposed files, admin panels, etc.

**Best for:** Finding exposed data via search engines  
**Output:** Ready-to-use Google dork queries by category  
**Legal:** ✅ Just Google searches (you execute manually)

### 10. Shodan Lookup
Queries Shodan for known information about an IP. Falls back to Censys if Shodan unavailable.

**Pricing:**
- Shodan: $60/month for 10,000 queries (most pentesters use this)
- Censys: FREE tier with 120 queries/month (better for budget)

**Best for:** Finding vulnerabilities already indexed by internet scanners  
**Output:** Open ports, services, known CVEs  
**Legal:** ✅ Querying public data (sign up free at Censys or Shodan)

### 11. Email Harvester
Finds email addresses associated with a domain (requires free Hunter.io API key).

**Best for:** Building email lists for authorized phishing simulations  
**Output:** Verified emails, naming patterns, confidence scores  
**Legal:** ⚠️ Use for authorized testing only (no unsolicited spam/phishing)

## Building Your Own Modules

Nyx is designed to be extended. Each module follows the same pattern:

```python
class MyModule:
    def __init__(self, target: str, verbose: bool = False):
        self.target = target
        self.results = {}

    def run(self) -> dict:
        # Do the work here
        self._analyze()
        self._display()
        return self.results

    def _analyze(self):
        # Logic goes here
        pass

    def _display(self):
        # Rich output goes here
        pass
```

Hook it into `main.py` and it's integrated into the interactive menu and CLI.

---

## Performance Tips

- **DNS brute-force is slow** — use a custom wordlist with only relevant subdomains
- **Port scanning is fastest with threading** — default is 100 workers
- **Shodan/Hunter queries count against your API quota** — batch them carefully
- **WAF detection with active probing** — may take 30+ seconds per target

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Module not found" error
Make sure all files are in the correct directory:
```
nyx/
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── modules/
    ├── dns_enum.py
    ├── whois_intel.py
    ... (all other modules)
```

### DNS lookups timing out
Some networks block DNS queries. Try:
```bash
pip install dnspython[DNSSEC]
```

### Port scanning getting blocked
If you get connection resets:
- Slow down with smaller thread count: edit `PortScanner` max_workers
- Or skip port scanning if not needed: use `--modules dns tech email` instead

### API key not working
- Verify you're using the correct key type (HIBP ≠ Shodan ≠ Hunter)
- Check you haven't hit rate limits
- Confirm your key has API access enabled

## Contributing

Want to add a module? Pull requests welcome! Each module should:

1. Follow the `__init__` → `run()` → `_display()` pattern
2. Use `rich` for output (not plain `print`)
3. Include docstring explaining what it does
4. Support mock mode if API-dependent
5. Be fully commented for educational value
